Abstraction is result of Encapsulation.
#
Inheritence is permission to extend property to subclass.
#
Polymorphism is use of that property in subclass.
## Points to remember
W can't achieve multiple inheritence in java so we use Interface.
#
Super can refer to sub but vice versa isn't possible.That means by using the refrence variable of super we can create the object of sub but vice-versa isn't possible. After that by using that obj if we invoke any method which is present in both then always the version of sub will invoke but in case of variable always the version of super will invoke.
#
variable--> super.var
methode--> super.method()
